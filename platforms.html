            <p>
              Irish biologists and clinical researchers need to access local resources for computation and data storage of genomic and related data.
              We are working with colleagues in the universities, in
              <a href="https://www.ichec.ie/">ICHEC</a> (Irish centre for high end computing) and 
              <a href="https://www.heanet.ie/">HEANET</a> (Higher Education Authority based)
              to explore new solutions that meet the emerging needs of biological data analysis, which involves large and sensitive (human) datasets of DNAs, RNAs, proteins, and other data features, and in some cases needs heavy CPU usage.
